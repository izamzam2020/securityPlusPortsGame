# Security+ SY0-701 Interactive Game For Learning Ports

This project is an interactive game I developed to help reinforce my knowledge of common ports and their associated services for the CompTIA Security+ certification. The game allows users to quickly test their understanding of port numbers and related protocols in a fun and engaging way.

Feel free to download, modify, and use the project for your own learning or training purposes.

# Usage
You can run the game locally using a tool such as XAMPP or WAMP, or upload it to any web server to play directly in your browser.
